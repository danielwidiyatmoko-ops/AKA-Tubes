okay so the todo list:
1. create a ui to select dataset size and select sorting algorithm
2. perhaps create even more varied datasets (the ones ive made are just randomly made with excel. maybe add an already sorted or backwards sorted one to see what happens)
3. benchmark the living shiet out of it (preferably using the same computer or even better a virtual machine with minimum ram and cpu)
4. understand how in the everloving fuck quicksort and mergesort works
